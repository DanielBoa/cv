# CV

I liked the look of the CV template I was using on Google Docs but got fed up of fighting the weird invisible tables for spacing, so I recreated it using HTML & CSS.

_Note: I created this with the sole intention of using the browers "Print to PDF" feature so that I could perfectly fit it onto a single A4 sheet._
